# Old Twilight SunClock Builds

Not intended to be any sort of an exhaustive list. These builds are meant more as a fallback for adventurous users in the case where an "official" build pushed to the Pebble store breaks some feature of interest.

At present these old builds are available here:

 - pebble-sunclock_3.3.pbw. Provides Pebble Classic (aplite) support. Does not include recent high-latitude fixes.

To load one of these images, ensure that your Pebble watch and phone are connected via bluetooth, and have a reasonable charge.

Then on your phone, browse to http://github.com/ewedel/pebble-sunclock. Touch the "Jump to file" link, and select the desired .pbw file from under old-builds/ (at present there is only old-builds/pebble-sunclock_3.3.pbw). github will then display a warning that the file is binary. Touch the "Open binary" link, and your phone should present you with an option to "complete action using" your Pebble app. Touch the Pebble icon and follow the prompts to install on your watch.
