# Old Twilight SunClock Builds

Not intended to be any sort of an exhaustive list. These builds are meant more as a fallback for adventurous users in the case where an "official" build pushed to the Pebble store breaks some feature of interest.

At present these old builds are available here:

 - pebble-sunclock_3.3.pbw. Provides Pebble Classic (aplite) support. Does not include recent high-latitude fixes.
