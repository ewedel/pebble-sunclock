          <p>A daily almanac for your Pebble.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Displays lunar phase, sunrise and sunset times, and grey bands representing civil, nautical and astronomical twilight on a 24-hour watch dial. An hour hand indicates the current time, somewhat in the fashion of a sundial gnomon, but it's good over all 24 hours. Also includes a digital time/date display, which honors your Pebble's 12/24 hour configuration.</p>

<h3>
<a name="instructions" class="anchor" href="#instructions"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Instructions</h3>

<p>For this version, no manual configuration is needed: the watchface
uses Pebble javascript to retrieve the user's current location and
timezone each time it is started. These values are saved in the watch
for those occasions when the phone / network connection is unavailable.</p>

<p>If you travel to another location or daylight savings time starts or
stops, simply ensure that your phone is connected to your Pebble and to
a location source (could be the phone network). Then bring up the
Twilight Sunclock watchface's settings page on your phone and touch the
Send button. The watchface display should update to reflect your
present location within a few seconds.</p>

<h3>
<a name="support" class="anchor" href="#support"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Support</h3>

<p>If you encounter display problems or other issues which you wish to report,
please use the watchface's settings page to ensure that the watchface is using
your current location. Click on the Send button to send the phone's current
location to the watch.  Then click Done to go back to the main configuration
page and click Show to display current location data.
If desired in the resulting display page you
may then touch the Decode button to find the name of some nearby location
(courtesy of <a href="http://geonames.org">geonames.org</a>). In any case,
please include the displayed lat, long and tz-off values with your error
report.  Submissions may be made via the Pebble application on
your phone.  Thank you!
       
<p>Note that, as of September
2014, the Android Pebble application caches the timezone value and does
not reflect timezone updates due to changes in location. The actual
position data is properly refreshed, but timezone data is not. You can
check for this by using the watchface's settings, and clicking on the
Show button: the tz-off line shows the (believed) offset in hours of your
present location from UTC. To bring the Pebble application's idea of timezone
back into sync with your present location, it seems to be necessary
to reboot your phone.</p>

<p>This is a Pebble v2.x port of a Pebble 1.x version. The 1.x line had a succession of contributors. It was originally created (to the best of my understanding) by Michael Ehrmann (<a href="https://github.com/mehrmann" class="user-mention">@mehrmann</a>) and then updated by <a href="https://github.com/KarbonPebbler" class="user-mention">@KarbonPebbler</a>, Chad Harp (<a href="https://github.com/harpchad" class="user-mention">@harpchad</a>), <a href="https://github.com/BobTheMadCow" class="user-mention">@BobTheMadCow</a> and David Orgeman (<a href="https://github.com/orgemd" class="user-mention">@orgemd</a>). (My apologies if I have left out any other contributors. If I have, please let me know.)</p>
